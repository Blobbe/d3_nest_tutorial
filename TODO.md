# This is the TODO list

## Minimum
 - implement priority historgram (change HTML to display 2 charts per row)
 - implement time histogram
 - Display the total amount of time of all tasks (computed using nest) somewhere in the page
 - convert histograms Y scale to percent instead of absolute value
 - implement button "Change colors" (change colors randomly)
 - implement the button "Only Joe" (reload charts with data filtered with only Joe's tasks)
 - implement the button "Only Done" (reload charts with data filtered with only DONE tasks)
 - implement treemap with who as colors and status as rectangles, with area based on total time needed by tasks

## Advanced
 - implement a bubble chart, with X axis as status, Y axis as priority and tasks as bubble with radius bigger for longer tasks.
 Watch out to randomize a little the position of the tasks (so that they are not drawn on the same spot)
